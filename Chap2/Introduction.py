#3. Describe the relationships between algorithm, data and computation. How do characteristic of the data and the current available computational resources influence the appropriateness of various algorithms?
# Algorithm is the function which takes as input the data and outputs the desired result. Computation is a measure of how many steps are needed until the algorithm is done. A lot of compute is needed if you have a lot of data, since the algorithm (in deep learning) can be extended to fit the data better. Deep learning usually works well in data rich environments. In data sparce environmnets deep learning algorithms rather memorize the data/overfit.
